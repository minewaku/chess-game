## How to play?
Chess is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 grid known as a chessboard. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The goal of the game is to checkmate your opponent's king, which means putting the king in a position where it is in check (threatened with capture) and there is no legal move to escape.

Checkmate doesnt work, players have to surrender through surrender button to end the match!
